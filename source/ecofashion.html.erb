		<h1> Telling the stories of our material connection

		<p> Sass Brown is an accomplished educator and author who was looking to create a news and resource site for all things Eco Fashion. In this project she was looking for an easy to use cms to post her articles and to upload different designers and businesses in the Eco-Fashion space while keeping the interface focused on the content.

		<h1> Front & Main </h1>
		<p class="no_headline"> One project that I worked on was creating the first Blog for West Elm. We wanted to create a blog that visually had a lot of handmade elements while showcasing different artists and products. One of the focuses was to create as much user engagement as possible by making sharing and commenting easy-to-use and user friendly. <p>
