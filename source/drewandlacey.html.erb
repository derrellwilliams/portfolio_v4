		<h1> Folk and Bluegrass combined with Nashville Country </h1>
		<p> Drew and Lacey are a country music duo out of Nashville, TN. Though I may be biased — they're family, after all — I figured this would be a perfect time to try out some of my front-end development skills I'd been learning. Drew and Lacey wanted a super simple site that got them started with an online presence while letting people who searched for them have some point of contact.  <br><span><a href ="http://drewandlacey.com">Launch the Site <span>&#8594;</span></a> </span><p>

		<h1> Album Artwork </h1>
