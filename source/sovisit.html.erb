		<h1> Show the world what your neighborhood has to offer</h1>
		<p> A while back, Nicole (my wife) and I were chatting about the lack of an online resource for our then neighborhood, East Harlem. Everything we could find on the neighborhood was either extremely outdated or hard to use. So we decided to build our own little platform to host small community sites to refer people to when they were looking for restaurants, apartments or even the history of a certain neighborhood. And that is how Sovisit was born.<br><span><a href ="http://sovist.us/in/eastharlem">Launch the Site <span>&#8594;</span></a> </span><p>

		<h1> Sovisit: East Harlem</h1>
		<p class="no_headline"> 
			The first neighborhood that we built under Sovisit was East Harlem, where we lived at the time. We really felt that it was an underated neighborhood with an amazing history that wasn't as well known as it's neighbors, Central and West Harlem. It also gave us a chance to begin to talk to our neighbors and local business owners. Meeting them and photographing their businesses was one of my favorite parts of the project, as getting to know the people behind the "digital" side of the product made it that more fulfilling when we started seeing them share their photos and pages with friends.

		<h1> Husband & Wife time</h1>
		<p class="no_headline"> 
		As it was only my wife and I, I did all of the branding, design and development, while she did a lot of copy writing and photography. I the whole thing from scratch, using just plain ol' HTML, CSS, JS, and made sure it was responsive to work across all devices.
