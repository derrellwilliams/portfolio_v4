		<h1> Everything you need to find a home you love </h1>
		<p> Urban Compass is a full end-to-end service for helping people find a home they love. The company was founded in late 2012 and I joined the team as the first full-time product designer in the beginning of 2013, about 4 months before the public launch of the company. I began concepting the product and creating wireframes with our head of product as we flushed out the problems we were trying to solve and how we were going to approach the very complex and political real estate space in New York. Over the next year we tested and iterated our original ideas as the company began to evolve based on our research and conclusions. By September 2013 we receieved our series A funding and we were valued at $150 million dollars. <span><a href ="http://urbancompass.com">Launch the Site <span>&#8594;</span></a> </span><p>

		<h1> The Homepage </h1>
		<p class="no_headline"> One project that was constantly evolving was our homepage. As we changed features and adjusted our positioning we had to keep the messaging clear and the user flow simple and to the point. The balance of a new user understanding the product and also getting them to sign up and begin using the product was always the main goal. Above are a few of the iterations of the homepages. <p>

		<h1> Scheduling Tool </h1>
		<p class="no_headline"> One of the early features that I concepted and designed was an online scheduling tool. I created a 4 step process in order to get the required information for our agents. One of the challenges of working for Urban Compass was that I always had to think of 3 parties: The User, The Agent, and the Landlord. All three of these people were crucial in the final result of finding an apartment, and it was always a challenge making sure the process was simple for all parties. <p>

		<h1> Search Tools</h1>
		<p class="no_headline"> One of the main parts of the product was allowing the user to search our inventory and get the best possible understanding of apartments and homes before spending anytime to go visit them. One of the challenges with this project was building a template that could respond to the myriad of variations of listings. Some had good photos, some didn’t, some had features listed, some didn’t, so we had to build a page that would withstand all of those changes while maintaining shape and hierarchy. Here are the search and listing pages we created. <p>

		<h1> App Development </h1>
		<p class="no_headline"> An important part of the Urban Compass experience was being able to access our inventory, schedule appointments, and to see your upcoming schedule on the go. For this we made sure our entire product was responsive, along with creating an iOS app which I designed and worked very closely with our mobile engineers in creation of the app. You can download the app here:
