		<h1> Everything you need to find a home you love </h1>
		<p> Urban Compass is a full end-to-end service for helping people find a home they love. The company was founded in late 2012 and I joined the team as the first full-time product designer in the beginning of 2013, about 4 months before the public launch of the company. I began concepting the product and creating wireframes with our head of product as we flushed out the problems we were trying to solve and how we were going to approach the very complex and political real estate space in New York. Over the next year we tested and iterated our original ideas as the company began to evolve based on our research and conclusions. By September 2013 we receieved our series A funding and we were valued at $150 million dollars. <p>

		<p class="no_headline"> One project that was constantly evolving was our homepage. As we changed features and adjusted our positioning we had to keep the messaging clear and the user flow simple and to the point. The balance of a new user understanding the product and also getting them to sign up and begin using the product was always the main goal. Above are a few of the iterations of the homepages. <p>
